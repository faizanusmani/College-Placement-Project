# College-Placement-Project
This is the project which I used in my college Placement Drive as an Engineering Undergraduate from KIIT University 2022 Batch

This Project is an E Commerce website where users can visit and they can create their own user accounts. The users can then login into the website using their accounts where they are allotted a default budget of Rs. 1000. The users can then see a list of items to choose from. They can purchase the items and their current budget will be modified accordingly. The users can also sell the products back to the webiste and then the items will again be listed back as products to be sold. Changes in the budgets of the users will be made accordingly.

Technologies Used:-
Front End:- HTML and CSS
Back End :- Python Flask
